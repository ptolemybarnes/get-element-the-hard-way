Getting a DOM Element
=======================

## Synopsis

This was written as part of the interview process for a tech company in north London.
The instruction was to write a function that returns DOM elements with the attribute(s) matching those given. To make things more interesting, js libraries as well as the document.querySelector functions were prohibited.  


## Technologies Used

- JavaScript 
- Jasmine 

## Favourite Code Snippet

## Still to complete/refactor

- DRY out the domDescriptionParser prototype. 

## Takeaway

At the outset I thought about how I might write a function to 'walk the dom' from parent to child elements, checking each. I realised though, looking at the example HTML document given, that there were no nested elements. This simplified things, though in the future it would be interesting to try to achieve this original notion.
